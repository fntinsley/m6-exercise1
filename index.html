    <p id="content-news" class="content">The two students who were suspended from North Paulding High School were simply doing what they thought was necessary to protect their health and the health of the people around them. The punishment they both swiftly incurred was not only wrong but truly embarrassing. During the Covid-19 Pandemic, schools were among some of the most common places to see increased widespread cases as in-person classes began to roll out again. Each state was tasked with handling the masking and social-distancing situation accordingly, and some states were more mindful of preventing further spread of the illness. </p>

    <h1 id="story-title" class="header">Tell Your Story</h1>
    <p id="content-story" class="content">Technology has come so far even in just the last ten years. The main technological advancement we tend to focus on as of late is the rise of Artificial Intelligence in our daily lives. But it’s important to note as well that most people roaming the Earth have a cell phone either in their pocket or close by at all times. This is a major driving factor in our society today, but it often goes unnoticed as it’s become a necessary part of our lives and almost an extension of our physical forms. The access to the internet through these devices comes with palpable benefits and severe detriments. What was created to connect us has inevitably driven people apart from each other in various ways. We’ve slowly become entrenched in the lives of others and are constantly bombarded with advertisements trying to sell us the next newest necessity.</p>

    <h1 id="title-ableism" class="header">Ableism</h1>
    <p id="content-ableism" class="content">The main scenarios that come to mind when reflecting on my own either unspoken or subconscious ableism stems from not always understanding the depths of disabilities and the range in how they may affect an individual. I completed four years of American Sign Language classes in high school and came to recognize people with deafness or partial hearing loss in my daily life. I was given opportunities to attend events with deaf people and build my confidence in communicating with them. Alongside this however, I began to realize how invisible this disability is for a lot of people. If you don’t know someone personally who is deaf and/or uses sign language, it’s really easy to just forget they exist until faced with them. I appreciated the opportunity in school to learn the intricacies of sign language and just how diverse and expansive it is. There are over 300 types of sign language, and people all over the world have found a sense of community with one another and share their lives with one another through such a beautiful language.</p>
